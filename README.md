# K-Shortest-Path-Ultimate-Search-PDC-Project
This project tackles the K Shortest Path Problem using a combination of MPI for distributed computing and OpenMP for shared memory parallelization within MPI processes. The goal is to find the Kth shortest path among all nodes of a given graph. The implementation includes reading graph data, and others
