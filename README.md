# K-Shortest-Path-Ultimate-Search-PDC-Project

This project tackles the K Shortest Path Problem using a combination of MPI for distributed computing and OpenMP for shared memory parallelization within MPI processes. The goal is to find the Kth shortest path among all nodes of a given graph. The implementation includes reading graph data, initializing a distance matrix, and using a parallelization strategy to distribute the computation across MPI processes, with loops parallelized using OpenMP. The project is tested on various datasets, including Doctor Who, Enron Email, and EU Email graphs. Further details can be found in below link.
